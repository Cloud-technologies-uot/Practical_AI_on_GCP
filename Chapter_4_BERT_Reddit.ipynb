He could craft the greatest of ballads, but no one would listen to them. They were too preoccupied with the two big-time poets in the neighboring castle. The poets called themselves ShakespeareA and ShakespeareB. Their work was terrible, but the common folk were so enticed with the original work of the real Shakespeare that the brand name just kept rolling. The two Shakes were so conceited that they even believed that they were actually Shakespeares, and built two identical Globes that they lived in. Dmitri was tired of their fookin shite. So he took a trip to the local assassin, a shady man who had a sweet tooth for bakery treats. The assassin was so corrupt that he\\'d kill a man for just a single scone. Dmitri hit it off with the assassin instantly, and they struck an emotional connection that still stands today. Dmitri\\'s poetry about cake plucked at the assassins heart strings, so he offered to lower his price to half a scone per man killed. Dmitri smiled and agreed, and before you could say \"iambic pentameter\" the two Shakes were found mysteriously dead, a silver arrow embedded in each of their necks. After this, the common folk began to listen to Dmitri\\'s poetry. They loved it! Dmitri enjoyed immense wealth, and he and the assassin lived in high luxury. One day a man went up to Dmitri, and asked how Shakespeare A and Shakespeare B had overshadowed him for so long.

Ving was always super cool with me. In exchange for answers (he was super smart) I would hang out with him and be his friend and stuff. After I cheated off of him and studied with him though, I did get to be his friend and we got very close. His sister, Ling, was always uptight about school and she made sure to study, she got stressed about a B, etc. One day I was hanging out with Ving, and we started talking about names. He went off on this huge rant about how he hated his, and how he wanted to change it to something more Asian-American, like Lee. I told him that the Courthouse downtown had a form that you could fill to legally change it. He told me:\\n\\n\"I always give you answers. If you could just drive me down to the courthouse this one time, I will never forget you. I just hate this god-forsaken Chinese name and I want to get rid of it forever.\" He seemed pretty adamant about it, so I decided the best decision would be to take him. We walked out to my car, and right as I put the keys in the ignition Ling came running and tapped on the car door like a madman. I rolled it down and she started freaking out about how Ving\\'s name had been passed down through generations and generations, but Ving didn\\'t care. He just wanted to go down to the Courthouse and get it over with. Ling figured that coming with would be the best idea, so if anything else came up that she would be needed for, she would be there for Ving. Honestly, I felt stuck in the middle of a family feud, so I just took her along.\\n\\nWhen we got to the Courthouse, Ving confidently walked up to the front desk and asked the receptionist if he could change his name. She gave him a little packet of paper and told him to sit down. Ling and I waited patiently while Ving filled out his info. I was watching him fill it out and I noticed he really did want to change his name to Lee. Before he finished, though, he started tearing up. He told me he couldn\\'t change his name. He asked the lady at the front that he couldn\\'t do it, and she told him he would need twenty dollars to cancel the request. Ling was so relieved and happy that he changed his mind, she dug through her purse, found the money, and started to hand it to the receptionist.\\n\\nIt was at this moment that the most stereotypical Asian man burst through the doors. He was wearing a Hawaiian shirt, a visor, American flag shorts, flip flops, everything. This little guy was decked out.\\nWhen Ving and his old man saw each other, they both started bawling, and embraced each other. Out of his tears, Ving said\\n\"Dad, I love my name.

First off, the house is covered in a bright purple paint which has been badly chipped from many years baking in the sun. Secondly, none of the house\\'s openings are level: windows are cracked and crooked, and the front door is slanted to the left. And, strangely enough, there is no paved pathway to the front door; simply worn grass, then patio, then door.\\n\\nDespite all of these oddities, the man proceeds to walk from his car, up the oil-stained driveway, across the path of matted-down brown grass, onto the crumbling concrete patio, and knocks on the old oak door with a resounding *thunk* *thunk*\\n\\nBut before the man could knock a third time, the door swung open, revealing a plump elderly lady dressed in a thick red cloak decorated many translucent pink scarves.

Bookcases line the walls with literature written in many different languages: Latin, English, Greek, French, and even a few the man was unable to identify. Sitting atop the bookcases are dusty knick-knacks ranging from snow globes and creepy red-fabric dolls to broken crystal balls and a cuckoo clock the man swears is running backwards.\\n\\nHe follows the lady into a warm and poorly-lit room draped in cotton and lace curtains. In the center is a card table covered with an elaborately-weaved purple and gold tablecloth. On the table is a glowing crystal ball sitting atop a beautifully engraved wooden bowl. The engravings show scenes of both erotic pleasure and horrible torture that the man hopes are symbolic for life rather than his own personal future.

Question in the exam paper : \\nIs Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?\\n\\nMost of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant.\\n\\nOne student, however, wrote the following:\\nFirst, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving, which is unlikely. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today.\\n\\nMost of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell.\\nSince there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than any one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.\\n\\nThis gives two possibilities:\\n\\n1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.\\n2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.\\n\\nSo which is it?\\nIf we accept the postulate given to me by Anabella during my Freshman year that, 'It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,' and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct; leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night,\\n\\nAnabella kept shouting 'Oh my God.'\\n\\nHe got an A+.\", 1], ['What did the child with no arms and no legs get for Christmas?

So a guy walks into a bar one day and he can’t believe his eyes. There, in the corner, there’s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.\\n\\nSo the guy asks the bartender, “Where’d he come from?”\\n\\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “There’s a genie in the men’s room who grants wishes.”\\n\\nSo the guy runs into the men’s room and, sure enough, there’s this genie. And the genie’s, like, “Your wish is my command.” So the guy’s, like, “O.K., I wish for world peace.” And there’s this big cloud of smoke—and then the room fills up with geese.\\n\\nSo the guy walks out of the men’s room and he’s, like, “Hey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.”\\n\\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”\\n\\nSo the guy processes this. And he’s, like, “Does that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?”\\n\\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “Yeah. Why, what did you wish for?”\\n\\nAnd the guy’s, like, “World peace.”\\n\\nSo the bartender is understandably ashamed.\\n\\nAnd the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it’s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.\\n\\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “I feel like I should explain myself further.”\\n\\nAnd the guy’s, like, “You don’t have to.”\\n\\nBut the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he’s, like, “I have what’s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It’s not that I’m small down there. I’m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.”\\n\\nAnd the guy feels sorry for him. So he’s, like, “Where do you think that comes from?”\\n\\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “I don’t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn’t tell her. I think it’s wrapped up in that somehow.”\\n\\nAnd the guy’s, like, “Have you ever seen anyone about this?”\\n\\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “Oh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we’ve barely scratched the surface.”\\n\\nSo, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he’s, like, “Listen, I couldn’t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn’t speak the last ten years of his life.”\\n\\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “Tell me more about that.” And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.\\n\\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist is, like, “He was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.”\\n\\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “That’s horrible.”\\n\\nAnd the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he’s, like, “You know what? I’m over it. He always said I wouldn’t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I’m a professional musician!”\\n\\nAnd the pianist starts to laugh, but it’s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he’s, like, “When he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .”\\n\\nAnd then he starts to cry. And he’s, like, “I just wish I’d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.”\\n\\nAnd all of a sudden there’s this big cloud of smoke—and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!\\n\\nAnd the pianist is, like, “I said ‘old man,’ not ‘old van’!”\\n\\nAnd everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, “Your genie’s hard of hearing.”\\n\\nAnd the bartender says, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”\\n\\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, “Oh, my God. You didn’t really want me.”\\n\\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “No, it’s not like that.” You know, trying to backpedal.\\n\\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, “Once an accident, always an accident.” And he drinks all of his whiskey.\\n\\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “Brian, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.”\\n\\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, “Well, I didn’t mean that.”\\n\\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “Whoa, calm down.”\\n\\nAnd the pianist is, like, “Fuck you!” And he’s really drunk, because he’s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he’s, like, “Fuck you, asshole! Fuck you!”\\n\\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he’s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender’s arms.\\n\\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he’s, like, “My God, I’m just like him. I’m just like him.” And he starts weeping.\\n\\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “No, you’re not. You’re better than he was.”\\n\\nAnd the pianist is, like, “That’s not true. I’m worthless!”\\n\\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, “Damn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You’re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.”\\n\\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\\n\\nSo the guy, who’s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn’t know the bartender was gay. It doesn’t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there’s the genie.\\n\\nSo the guy’s, like, “Hey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.”\\n\\nAnd the genie’s, like, “Who says they’re broken?” And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\\n\\nAnd the guy’s, like, “Well done.”\\n\\nAnd then the genie says, “That bartender’s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.”\\n\\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\\n\\nAnd the genie’s, like, “I’m sorry. I should’ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.”\\n\\nAnd the guy’s, like, “Don’t worry about it. Let’s just grab a beer. It’s on me.” \", 0], ['Michael died while working at the clock factory. None of his friends were sad about it, they all said his time had come.', 0], ['Why did the hipster burn his mouth?

He asks him what he would like as a present, and the boy replies that he would like a parrot. His dad replies that he can't have a real parrot, but searches all around and eventually finds a plastic parrot toy. The boy's mother assures him that it will all be ok and they sit down with their son to open his presents. The father worriedly hands the plastic parrot to his son but the boy immediately loves his gift and will not stop playing with it. That Christmas, the boy asks for another plastic parrot to play with, so his dad goes back to the store and gets another. The boy is overjoyed and can't stop playing with his parrots. The next year he asks again for a plastic parrot, and his dad is surprised that he is still so interested in parrots, but complies. He begins to amass more and more toy parrots. On his sixth birthday his parents throw him a parrot themed party. By this point he has started school and some of the kids in his class come to the party.\\n'Your kid really does like parrots' some of the parents note when they are dropping their children off at the party.\\nThe boy's parents shrug it off, thinking it is just a phase. But year after year, the boy keeps asking for plastic parrots for his birthday, and his entire room is full of them, along with the parrot themed wallpaper and duvet cover. By his eighth birthday he has around 30 plastic parrots, this later rises to 50 by the time he is 10. He is finding it increasingly hard to make friends at school, preferring to stay home and play with his parrots instead of hanging out with humans. At the age of 13 his parents take him to a psychiatrist to ask if there is anything wrong, but he is completely normal. He goes to another psychiatrist, but is told the same.\\n'He just really likes parrots'.\\nBy the age of 14 the situation is starting to take its toll on the family. The house becomes filled with plastic parrots and his mother cannot handle it anymore. She gets into arguments with the father and eventually walks out on him and the boy. This event makes parrot boy even more depressed and so by his 15th birthday, even though his parents no longer give him plastic parrots directly, he spends all his birthday money on parrots. \\nBy this point the dad is furious. He asks his son, 'Why are you so obsessed with these plastic parrots?' but his son simply blanks him and walks away. Every time he brings it up in conversation, he changes the subject.\\nWhen the boy turns 16 his dad tells him he needs to get a job, because he cannot keep giving him money for plastic parrots. He becomes a waiter in a local restaurant, and things start to look up.\\nHe is actually leaving his bedroom to socialise rather than play with parrots, he even meets a girl at work and eventually she becomes his girlfriend. He gives some of his plastic parrots to a charity that gives toys to disadvantaged children.\\nBut things come crashing down when him and his girlfriend split up. Just one time, he asks her to dress up as a parrot for him and she doesn't comply, storming out of the house calling him a freak. This makes his plastic parrot addiction worse, he buys more and more, begins hoarding them, hiding them from his dad. But one day his dad finds a bunch under the bed.\\nInstead of screaming at the son, his dad breaks down and cries.\\n'Is there anything I can do to make it stop? Is there anything in the world you want more than plastic parrots?' the dad begs with his son.\\n'Well, there is one thing,' he replies. 'I still can't drive, and I would really like a car.'\\nThe dad runs off, booking his son a driving instructor immediately. After a few months of lessons the boy is really getting the hang of driving. His dad is so proud. The plastic parrots have once again been sold off or given away and it seems the son is cured. He takes his driving test and passes the first time. He is so pleased and his dad so proud of him that he takes him to a garage and asks him to pick out a car. Whichever car, no matter how expensive, if it will stop the parrots. The boy is not too fussy, he is happy with a ford focus. The next day he drives off in his new car, but his dad receives a phone call. His son has been in an accident and crashed. He rushes to the hospital but it soon becomes clear that his son has been badly hurt.\\n'His injuries are serious but he is stable, and he will probably pull through,' his dad is told.\\nHis dad runs into the room to speak with his son, terrified after what has happened.\\n'Son, I love you so much. But please tell me, just incase anything like this ever happens again, but worse. The only thing I want to ask you and have ever wanted to ask you in my entire life, is why are you so obsessed with the parrots?'\\nHe looks at his son, who starts to cry.\\n'Dad I love you. And I am so sorry I kept it from you,' his son replies. He knows that it is time for the truth. 'The real reason that I'm so obsessed with plastic parrots is'..........\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n and then he died.\\n\", 0], ['TIL A ball of glass will bounce higher than a ball of rubber.

They are paid to take time off teaching, but they have to do research to better their knowledge, to better their teaching. \\nGot it? \\nGood. \\nSo, both teachers are given a sabbatical. And, they\\'re very good friends. So, they decide, on this sabbatical they will travel to far reaches of Africa to do some History research and some Anthropology research (Anthropology is the study of human nature). They decide that\\'s what they\\'re going to do. So, they go running down the stairs in their apartment building. *clop-clop-clop-clop* They get into a taxi-cab. *err...err....err* They get to the airport. They go through security. *beep-beep-beep-beep* And all that stuff, you know? They get on the plane. *woosh* Now they\\'re in Africa. They get off the plane. They get on a little plane. *pt..pt...pt...pt* They fly over this tiny little village. The get off the tiny little plane, and there\\'s this Jeep waiting right there for them - with their name on it. So, they get in the Jeep. *zh-zhoom* And they start driving down the road. They\\'re going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...They\\'re seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. Then, they get to this little pygmy village. So, they get out and ask the pygmies, \"What is something just great to see here, where we are?\" They say, \"Well, our rather hit attraction would be a pink gorilla.\" \"A pink gorilla?! No way! You\\'re totally lying!\" The pygmies are like, \"No, actually you just go down this road, take a left turn, then turn right into a big cave.\" So, they get back in the Jeep (which starts right up). *zhoom* So they\\'re going down the road; they\\'re going up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down...They\\'re seeing all sorts of animals - elephants, giraffes, zebras, every kind of animal you could think of. They make their left turn.

They\\'re going open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close. They get through all the doors. There\\'s a big pool of water, and right next to it is some scuba gear. So they put on the scuba gear and dive in. So, they\\'re swimming....swim, swim, swim.....deep water.....swim, swim, swim....very deep water....swim, swim, swim....very, very deep water....Finally, they see another way out, so they swim towards that and get out of the water. \\nThey see the pink gorilla! \\nAll it\\'s doing is sitting there, completely still.

The entire time they\\'re watching the pink gorilla, there\\'s one little thing the pygmies said that keeps flashing through they\\'re mind. \"Don\\'t touch the pink gorilla.\" Now, they\\'re like, \"Why can\\'t we touch the pink gorilla? All he\\'s doing is sitting there, completely still.\" But, the Historian was rather smart. The Anthropologist, on the other hand, was like I wish I could get my hands on this thing. I could make a lot of money! So, the Anthropologist walks up and he\\'s about to touch the pink gorilla. And the other guy grabs his hand and says, \"No! You heard what the pygmies said, \\'Don\\'t touch the pink gorilla.\\'\" But, the Anthropologist is just like, \"What could it do?\" The Historian manages to talk him out of touching it, and they keep taking pictures and writing notes about it\\'s behavior - but there aren\\'t very many \\'cause all it\\'s doing is sitting there, completely still. Finally, they\\'re ready to leave. They put the scuba gear back on, and get back in the water. So, they\\'re swimming again....swim, swim, swim.....very, very deep water.....swim, swim, swim....very deep water....swim, swim, swim....deep water....Finally, they see original surface, so they swim towards that and get out of the water.

Okay...I\\'ve got to get this thing out of here. So, he reaches out towards the gorilla. The whole time the pygmies\\' warning is playing in the back of his mind. Don\\'t touch the pink gorilla. He hesitates. \\nAnd then...\\nHe touches the pink gorilla! The pink gorilla goes mad. He\\'s like tearing the place apart! The guy screams.

So they look into the problem, and realise that, although the showers themselves are fast enough, the prisoners actually spend a suspiciously long amount of time drying themselves - causing another possible security threat. The managers then hit on the idea of installing a sort of drying cubicle next to the shower, where each prisoner would enter, be assailed by strong blasts of air from all directions, and be fully dry within half a minute, thus leaving them with no excuse to loiter in the shower.\\n\\nSo they install these drying boxes for the prisoners, and at first they seem to be a great success. However, although the machines worked, they were so powerful that they caused a lot of noise, even from outside of the boxes, and - this is important - the noise could be heard in the managers\\' offices. So the managers decided to find another solution, and remove the drying machines, because they couldn\\'t do any work with that cacophony happening every evening.\\n\\nWhen the technician eventually arrives at the prison to remove the machines, he seems rather reluctant for some reason, but the managers insist he does the deed.

First of all, - just for some background: My Mum died right when I was born, (she was actually really, really hot- but this isn't about her. I guess that's fucked up to say, but whatever.) I actually grew up with my dad's family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.\\n\\nAnyways, growing up I feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.\\n\\nI don't want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself. I knew she didn't make it for me- but I thought she was so fucking beautiful that I watched it twice. I probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy shit went down and I had to leave home. (My dad's family who I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it).\\n\\nSooo... I was totally lusting after my sister at that point. She was also having bad trouble with the law. She was actually in custody when I left home.\\n\\nMy friend and I went to go pick her up. When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to fuck her brains out. Looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for me too. She actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly.\\n\\nAfter we left, we all went to crash with my Sister's friends. On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my Sister, and I got a little jealous. He's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- I just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging.\\nPretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. I'm not saying that I'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time.\\n\\nMy friend and my sister never hooked up I don't think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that I got really badly hurt in an accident. It was fucked up. I almost died. But when I was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips.\\n\\nSadly (although, I guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. We spent some time apart... and I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way. It was actually going well for a long time- like I was totally over her.\\n\\nBut I have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini I've ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings. Sigh.\\n\\nA little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). I can't say I was surprised.\\nBut even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone.\\n\\nIt was a really intimate moment.

He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he\\'d try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn\\'t much like the idea of her screwing someone else. So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation. The old man said, \"Well, I don\\'t really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don\\'t know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except.... and he stopped. \"Except what?\" the man asked. \"Nothing, nothing.\" \"C\\'mon, tell me! I need something!\" \"Well, sir, I don\\'t usually mention this, but there is the \\'voodoo dick.\\'\" \"So what\\'s up with this voodoo dick?\" he asked.\\n\\nThe old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols.

It looks like every other dildo in this shop!\" The old man replied, \"But you haven\\'t seen what it\\'ll do yet.\" He pointed to a door and said \"Voodoo dick, the door.\" The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said \"Voodoo dick, get back in your box!\" The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there quiescent once more. \"I\\'ll take it!\" said the businessman. The old man resisted, saying it wasn\\'t for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say \"Voodoo dick, my pussy.\" He left for his trip satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone.\\n\\nAfter he\\'d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick.

After three orgasms, she decided she\\'d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked.

She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo.

The Orthodox would have assassinated this New Caesar too, but alas, for them, it was December, the month in which they were not allowed to kill any Caesers, so they sent an emissary to the Germanic tribes pleading that they would retire their request and simply give up pork anyway. \\n\\n\\nThe Germanic Tribes replied, \"well, what are you going to give us for it?\" The Clerics retorted by sending a real to life Nativity scene, [which the Germanic tribes mistook as a hovel of immigrant refugees], a band of minstrels to play Christmas carols, and a holy hand grenade. The Germanic tribes replied by returning the super drunk minstrels singing only \"O Tanambaum!\" along with a huge pile of bundles wrapped in shiny colored wrappings, pine trees covered in candles, spiral cut ham soaked in glaze, kielbasa and enough of bacon for the whole senate while wishing them a happy holiday. \\n\\n\\nThe clerics were confused of course, and asked them just where all of this crap was coming from, since it was clearly not in their holy books, to which the Germanic tribes replied, \"what book?\"  The Clerics said \"You know, Your T.O.s!\" to which the Germanic tribes replied \"there\\'s a Technical Order for this Bull Crap??\" and upon being shown the book, replied \"Oh, we only read German, and sometimes that demotic American language the English named after themselves\" [To which the Scottish, the Welsh, and the Irish all retorted \"WE\\'RE NOT ENGLISH!\", but never mind them!] and then Caesar added \"heh, I read it, bits and parts, but it\\'s all Greek to me.\" The Clerics were mostly confused and quite bemused, because at that point Everybody could read, write, sing, sleep and even eat Greek.   \\n\\n\\nBut they decided they simply needed to try harder, and soon, they were at their wits end, because they couldn\\'t figure out how to translate their holy book into something the German people might read [they tried three translations, of course, but the first was full of words so complicated that the Germans stared blankly back for hours, the second was so dry that it put the Germans to sleep, and the third got lost in translation altogether.\\n\\n\\nThe Clerics, at their wits end trying to reconcile this matter of differences, went to the senate for help, to which Caesar retorted \"Then maybe we should consult an Oracle, or a Sage, or...Siri?\" The Clerics immediately said \"NO ORACLES!\" [but not because they violate the New Holy Book, not being of the Christian religion and all as one might expect their objection to be, but because the last time they consulted an Oracle, they ended up with a King who killed his father and married his mother and they really, really, REALLY wished to avoid that whole bloody Fucked up affair if they could. This left the Sages and Siri, but alas, it being winter, Sage was out of season, and they were about 2000 years too early to consult Siri. \\n\\n\\nFinally, when all seemed lost, the clerics and the senators and Caesar alighted upon the fact that they were all the smartest people in the village, so that meant what they needed was the village idiot, someone so simple and autistically asbergerish as to see what they might have overlooked.  The village idiot wasn’t too hard to find, luckily enough; they simply had to put a plate of glass in the village square and wait for someone to come along and try licking it, which happened way too quick and soon they had to take down the glass in fear that they might be overrun with idiot candidates or that the whole village might turn out to be idiots, which was very well possible because of all the lead in their diets due to the lead pipes that delivered the town drinking water.  \\n\\n\\nThe head idiot, though, luckily enough was rather good at reading the word of the Good Book, and after speed reading it like a good Christian cherry picker on a holy book Sundae at an Atheist debate rally, he promptly closed the book and replied “Doesn’t apply.”  “HUH????” said the entire crowd, to which he clarified: “Well, you see here, this section here applies only if you’re in Canaan, well, actually, just to the people in Canaan, and we’re not in Canaan, now are we?”  This made sense to all but one Cleric, who replied “Where the Fuck is Canaan?”  To which the idiot pointed out that it was anywhere near where Jews use Salem might be, to say hello and goodbye and peace ahem, around Jerusalem.  \\n\\n\\nThe entirety of Europe cheered when they found this out, and they promptly declared every week in January the Holy Bacon Fest to celebrate their great divine favor in being granted moral access to the heavenly gift of bacon, pork loin, keilbasa, ham, bratwurst, and pepperoni, which they all found went great on flatbread if accompanied with a little cheese; to expand their supplies, they went so far as to confiscate every bit of it from Canaan, telling the unwashed gentiles that they were just pig out of luck and they should have moved to Rome when they had a chance.  \\n\\n\\nAnd all was well, except you may remember that Holy Hand Grenade.

Indeed, she was often called Amazon Dot Com.\\n \\nAnd she said unto Abraham, her husband, \"Why dost thou travel so far from town to town with thy goods when thou canst trade without ever leaving thy tent?\"\\n \\nAnd Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, \"How, dear?\"\\n \\nAnd Dot replied, \"I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale, and they will reply telling you who hath the best price. The sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah\\'s Pony Stable (UPS).\"\\n \\nAbraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums.  And the drums rang out and were an immediate success.  Abraham sold all the goods he had at the top price, without ever having to move from his tent.\\n \\nTo prevent neighboring countries from overhearing what the drums were saying, Dot devised a system that only she and the drummers knew.  It was known as Must Send Drum Over Sound (MSDOS), and she also developed a language to transmit ideas and pictures - Hebrew to the People (HTTP).\\n \\nAnd the young men did take to Dot Com\\'s trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung.

And lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums that no one noticed that the real riches were going to that enterprising drum dealer, Brother William of Gates, who bought off every drum maker in the land. Indeed he did insist on drums to be made that would work only with Brother Gates\\' drum heads and drumsticks.\\n \\nAnd Dot did say, \"Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others.\" And Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or eBay as it came to be known.

Not knowing where to turn and having $10 in his wallet, he walks past a farmers\\' market and sees a stand selling 25 lb. crates of beautiful red tomatoes. He buys a crate, carries it to a busy corner and displays the tomatoes. In less than 2 hours he sells all the tomatoes and makes 100% profit. Repeating the process several times more that day, he ends up with almost $100 and arrives home that night with several bags of groceries for his family.\\n\\nDuring the night he decides to repeat the tomato business the next day. By the end of the week he is getting up early every day and working into the night.

He continues to work hard.\\n\\nTime passes and at the end of the fifth year he owns a fleet of nice trucks and a warehouse that his wife supervises, plus two tomato farms that the boys manage.

He didn’t have many animals, but he did have two he loved immensely: his dog Spot, and his prize winning race horse, the fastest horse ever to run in the Kentucky Derby, Bolt. One day, the farmer and Spot were in the stables to watch a mare give birth to Bolt’s child. But to their surprise, the mare gave birth to not one, but two, strong, healthy foals. The farmer named the first born Buck and the second Casper.\\nFrom the very beginning, Buck and Casper shared their father’s competitive spirit. Within seconds of both being born, Buck looks at Casper and says “Hey brother! Let’s see who can stand up first.” Casper agreed, “Challenge accepted.” Buck tried to stand first, got half-way erect, and then fell over. Next Casper tried to stand, made it all the way up, wobbled, and fell down. Spot and the farmer watched intently, as this continued back and forth for a couple minutes, each brother standing a little longer than the other, until eventually Buck stood up and remained standing. “I win!” exclaimed Buck. “You sure did,” Casper replied “but it was very close. I know I’ll win next time!”\\nSome time passes, and the farmer decides that Buck and Casper are now old enough to be let out of the stables and explore the farm. The farmer, Spot and all the other animals gather around to watch the two young horses get their first taste of the outdoors. As soon as the two foals exit the stables, Buck turns to Casper and says “You see that fence across the field? Let’s have a race! First one to the fence and back wins.” “You’re on!” Casper replies.\\nAnd so the two horses take off towards the fence. First, Buck takes the lead, then Casper pulls ahead, then Buck takes the lead again as they reach the fence. On the way back the two horses are neck-and-neck, Casper ahead one second, Buck the next. Casper gives his all and takes a slight lead. “I’m going to win” he excitedly thinks, but at the last second Buck has a burst of speed and pulls ahead by a foot, winning the race. “I win!” Buck neighs loudly. “You sure did brother,” Casper replies “but that was very close. I’ll win the next race, I just know it.”\\nHaving witnessed their race, the farmer decides to enter them in the next local horse derby. The farmer and Spot sit in the stands, watching with anticipation as the horses line up, Buck and Casper next to each other in lanes 3 and 4. “This is it! This is the race I’m going to beat you!” Casper says to Buck. “Probably brother! You are very fast and trained very hard” Buck says in return. At the sound of the gunshot, Buck and Casper take off out of the gates. They very quickly get way ahead of the other horses, and the two brothers stay neck-and-neck. First buck is ahead by a few inches, then Casper gets the lead, then Buck again, then Casper; back-and-forth until it seems like Casper finally has the lead. “I got it this time!” Casper whinnies in excitement, but suddenly Buck is right there next to him, and before Casper could dig deep for a burst of speed, they cross the finish line, Buck just a few inches ahead. “Drat!” Casper says, a little upset. “That was so close! I could taste victory.” “It was a very good race brother!” Buck says, “I’m very proud of you, that was the closest we’ve ever been. I thought you had it for sure.”\\nA few years pass of Buck and Casper racing, training, and growing. Year after year the farmer enters them into the races, year after year the farmer and Spot watch, and year after year Buck wins by a hair, with Casper getting closer and closer with each race. Finally, Buck and Casper are so fast and so famous – The Twin Bolts, they’re called – that they both get invited to compete in the Kentucky Derby. On the big day, the farmer and Spot watch from home on the TV as Buck and Casper wish each other luck, and go to their gates to await the race. The starting gun fires, and all the horses take off. This time it’s a very close race; all the horses stay tight in a pack for most of the track. But near the end, all the horses begin to tire and slow – all the horses except for Buck and Casper.\\nCasper manages to get a good lead, and he looks back to his brother and yells “I’m going to win this time, there’s nothing you can do!” But his cockiness got the better of him, and the farmer, Spot, and Buck all watched in horror as just before the finish line, Casper loses his footing and takes a terrible fall, knocking himself out.\\nAfter the race, Casper wakes up back home in the stables, Buck watching over him intently. “How do you feel Casper” Buck asks with concern, but Casper can think only of the race. “Did I win?” he asks. “Did I finally beat you?” Buck shakes his head solemnly “I’m afraid not brother. You stopped just in front of the finish line. The race was stopped because of your injury, but I was declared the winner since I was in second place.”\\nCasper is devastated by this news. “…but …I was going to win” he says sadly, trying to stand. But one of Casper’s front legs gives him a sharp pain, and he falls over. “Are you okay Casper?” Buck asks, concern heavy in his voice. “The vet said you broke your leg. You need to give it time to heal.”\\nAnd so he did, but time never fully healed his leg. For years, Casper stayed at the farm, limping as he tried to run, while Buck continued to win Derby after Derby, eventually breaking his father Bolt’s speed record and winning more Derbies than any other horse in memory. Spot would watch Casper from the porch, saddened by the state of the once proud equine.\\nMany years later, the farmer retires Buck from racing. The two horses, now old, spend most of their time in the stables, Casper always quiet and sad. One day, Buck turns to Casper and says “You know brother, I miss the old days when we would race side-by-side. What do you say to one last race, huh?” But Casper shakes his head and says “There’s no point. Even in my prime, I could never beat you. What chance do I have now that I am old and lame?” Saddened by his brother’s depression, Buck gets an idea. “You know what brother? You’re the reason I ran so fast. You inspired me, our whole lives, to push myself and be the best I could be. I always looked up to you.” This makes Casper a little happy, so Buck continues “I bet that you, my greatest inspiration, will beat me. There’s no way you’ll lose again, you’re too good”. “Alright,” Casper says, his spirits high for the first time in years “I’ll race you. To the fence and back, just like when we were kids. And this time I’ll win!”\\nAs Buck and Casper exit the stables, Spot – now also very old – pads over to watch. The two horses start running, much slower than in previous years, but still with as much intensity as their younger selves would muster. Casper, his excitement allowing him to ignore his old injury, takes the lead. Buck, digging deep, catches up, and they continue neck-and-neck. On the final stretch, Casper pulls ahead. After so many years, he’d finally get to know what it felt like to be number one, first place, the winner. Casper had never felt more proud or excited than at this moment in his life. But just before as he reaches the barn, Buck bolts past him, winning by a hair. Casper is crushed.\\nNow Spot, who watched the young horses grow up from afar, gets angry at this. He walks up to Buck and growls “Why?! After all the years, after all your victories, why? You couldn’t let your brother have this one race? You just broke his heart!” To which Buck replies\\n“Holy shit, a talking dog!”', 0], [\"Van Gogh's best friend was his brother Theo He would often lend him an ear.\", 0], ['What do you call a Mexican who lost his car?

On the day of the competition, both teams thought themselves to be in top condition, but the Japanese won by a kilometer.\\n\\nAfter the loss, there was an atmosphere of defeat in the Finnish team. However, the leadership of the company decided that they had to win next year, for image reasons. They assigned a project group to solve the problem. After long analysis of the problem, they found that the Japanese had seven rowers and one person who steers(translation?), whereas the Finns had one rower and seven steerers(?).\\n\\nIn this crisis the leadership showed considerable ability to perform. Consults were hired to investigate how the team was put together. After a few months\\' work, experts arrived at the conclusion that there were too many steerers and too few rowers. Based on the report from the experts, the leadership of the company immediately made changes to the team. There were now four steerers, two executive steerers, a team leader and a rower. Additionally, a bonus point system was developed to motivate the rower. \"We have to extend his job and give him more responsibility.\"\\n\\nThe next year the Japanese won by two kilometers. The Finnish team fired the rower for bad performance, but still paid a bonus to the leadership for the efforts they had made.\\n\\nFor next year, the Finns are developing a new boat.', 1], ['What do you get when you mix a gorilla and a black person?

Tell you what I will marry you if you can become a frosted cheerio\" So our guy goes back with a determination and gets a job and starts to pay off his debts.

Now he goes back to the princess and asks her again, \"will you marry me?\" she says \"no honey you really do have to become a frosted cheerio first.\" So he goes back and he works and works, hes a fryboy at McGrubers or something, I don\\'t care. So he works and he works and he gets promoted at the restaurant and is making more money. And he works and he works and he works and by having that income raise he finally becomes a level 3 cheerio. He feels successful for the first time in his life but he is starting to fall back on his old ways. One day he goes to the casino and he loses and he loses and he loses and he gambled all his money away and he gets fired to boot because gambling is against company policy. So he is back down to a level 1 cheerio. He gets a job on a production line at a nearby factory and determines himself not to fall back ever again. So he works and he works and he works and he works and he WORKS, level 2, level 3, and he is doing great again. He is promoted to Floor manager of the factory and he is doing great and becomes a level 4 cheerio.

They have to pay out damages and PR and the like and they declare bankruptcy. He is knocked back down to level 2 for the lack in income. But he is hired almost straight away by a branch of a huge conglomerate because they recognized how hard of a worker he is. So he works, level 3, works, level 4, and he works and works and WORKS. So he is promoted to CEO of the branch that he works in. A few months pass and he is approaching level 5 status when the Head of the entire conglomerate decides to retire. He weighs his options for his replacement and sees our guy and what a hard worker he is and chooses him as his replacement. So our guy is now the CEO of a huge company, a level 5 cheerio and making Bill Gates level money and he finally becomes a Frosted Cheerio.

So he waits and he waits and he waits and he waits 15 minutes and the bartender still hadn\\'t shown up so he decided he must have gone home since the party was winding down. So he went back to his wife and tells her the bartender wasn\\'t there, can I get you something else? she replies: \"Ok, its fine. Here take this dollar and go buy me a Diet Coke at the vending machine in the lobby. So he goes to get it and there\\'s a line for the machine. It was the princesses wedding so obviously a lot of people would show up. So he waits and he waits and he waits in line and he finally gets up to the machine only to find that the prices were hiked because they knew they could gouge them. So he goes back to his wife gets another dollar and waits and waits and WAITS in line only to find once he finally reached the front that they were out of Diet Coke. So he buys a regular Coke instead and takes it to his wife. She throws it away saying she needs to keep her figure yadda, yadda, yadda. So she tells him to get a cup off the table and get her some water from the cooler.

And the pianist is, like, “Your genie’s hard of hearing.”\\n\\nAnd the bartender says, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”\\n\\nAnd as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, “Oh, my God. You didn’t really want me.”\\n\\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “No, it’s not like that.” You know, trying to backpedal.\\n\\nAnd the pianist smiles ruefully and says, “Once an accident, always an accident.” And he drinks all of his whiskey.\\n\\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “Brian, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.”\\n\\nAnd the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, “Well, I didn’t mean that.”\\n\\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “Whoa, calm down.”\\n\\nAnd the pianist is, like, “Fuck you!” And he’s really drunk, because he’s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he’s, like, “Fuck you, asshole! Fuck you!”\\n\\nAnd he starts throwing punches, but he’s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender’s arms.\\n\\nAnd suddenly he has this revelation. And he’s, like, “My God, I’m just like him. I’m just like him.” And he starts weeping.\\n\\nAnd the bartender’s, like, “No, you’re not. You’re better than he was.”\\n\\nAnd the pianist is, like, “That’s not true. I’m worthless!”\\n\\nAnd the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, “Damn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You’re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.”\\n\\nAnd the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.\\n\\nSo the guy, who’s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn’t know the bartender was gay. It doesn’t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there’s the genie.\\n\\nSo the guy’s, like, “Hey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.”\\n\\nAnd the genie’s, like, “Who says they’re broken?” And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.\\n\\nAnd the guy’s, like, “Well done.”\\n\\nAnd then the genie says, “That bartender’s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.”\\n\\nAnd the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.\\n\\nAnd the genie’s, like, “I’m sorry. I should’ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.”\\n\\nAnd the guy’s, like, “Don’t worry about it. Let’s just grab a beer.
